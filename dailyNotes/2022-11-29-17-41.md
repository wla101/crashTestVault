what have we done today as a follow up to yesterday?

- (yesterday) converted repo to public  
- today on Bill's iMac we corrected all the private repo file permissions that were attached to all the repo files in the OneDrive vault by cloning the repo into a separate folder and comparing file-by-file  
- several observations: a number of `index` files were present. it seems that OneDrive made copies when permissions did not allow `git` to update them? that is one current speculation.  
- added band as a collaborator so that Obsidian-git could push some changes from the iMac  
- these notes are being made on the Win10-instance
