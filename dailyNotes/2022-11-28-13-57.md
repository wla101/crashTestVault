- so confused from yesterday and wondering how everything can be kept in sync or how many different instances there are of the Github repo; or is it the OneDrive folder that is the home base; or what? perhaps we need a picture .... this needs a Scapple pic and a UML sequence diagram for the interactions between Obsidian and the vault and the Github repo and the OneDrive folder.  
- but first we investigate the Obsidian-git `remote: repository not found` error from yesterday.  

- one thing to notice using OneDrive is that this files is updated across machines immediately - i am editing this in Obsidian on the Win10-instance  
- hmmm .... this reminds me of `Syncthing` except that it is contained in OneDrive  
-  i wonder if a similar affordance obtains with, say, GoogleDrive, or DropBox 
-  let's see what happens if we try to use `git`  
 - got an error of not being able to change the `index` file -- private repo issue?  my errors seem to stem from trying to use a private repo - the `index` file cannot be updated so it is copied perhaps leading to syncronization errors?
