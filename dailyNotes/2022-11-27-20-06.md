- whew! that took longer than expected. a few gotchas, such as, no message about missing `dailyNotes` folder when selecting "Open today's daily note".

- and then we had to download the OneDrive app because this Win10 instance was a server not a client.
- and it seems that once the OD setup is connected to the existing Documents/ directory that some previous work is now invisible which is something i do not understand. ah well, more later.

- next step? make this a Githup repo.
